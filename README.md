# Solana Keypair Generator from Mnemonic

This project demonstrates how to generate multiple Solana keypairs from a mnemonic phrase using Python. The keypairs are derived using the BIP44 standard derivation path.

## Prerequisites

Before running the script, you need to install the required libraries:

```bash
pip install solders mnemonic bip_utils base58
